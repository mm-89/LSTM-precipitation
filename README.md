# Precipitation Forecasting with LSTM  
*A work-in-progress machine learning project (PyTorch)*

## Overview
This project explores the use of **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural networks to model and forecast precipitation based on historical time-series data.  
The goal is to evaluate how well recurrent architectures can capture temporal patterns in rainfall and improve short-term prediction accuracy.

Although the project is still under development, the repository already includes the initial data processing pipeline, baseline models, and early LSTM prototypes.

## Objectives
- Build a reproducible precipitation time-series dataset  
- Train and evaluate a baseline LSTM model  
- Experiment with different architectures (stacked LSTM, bidirectional LSTM, etc.)  
- Compare performance with simpler baselines (persistence, linear regression, etc.)  
- Visualize predictions vs. ground truth  

## Current Status
The project is **in progress** and updated during my free time.  
Model experiments, data preparation routines, and evaluation metrics will be expanded over time.

## Requirements
- Python >3.9  
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  

(Additional dependencies will be added as the project evolves.)
